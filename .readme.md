## How to Use

Mainly for me because I never remember the way to do this ...

Based on the first section of the [archwiki entry] for dot file management.

### Setup

1. Clone this repo into `~/.dots` using the 

```
git clone --bare git@github.com:snsvrno/dots.git ~/.dots
```

2. Bootstrap fish (because I use fish) by "reseting" it. Probably backup the directory first in case important stuff is there.

```
git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME checkout HEAD ~/.config/fish
```

Now the `dots` command will manage that `~/.dots` repo

3. Remove all untracked files from `dots status`

```
dots config status.showUntrackedFiles no
```

4. Now we can use the shortcut `dots-restore` to slowly import the global files into the local system.

```
dots-restore .config/starship.toml
```
